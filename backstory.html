      <h3>Before Gambit</h3>
      <p>Since a young age I have always been fascinated with snakes</p>
      <p>
        I remember a particular story from my childhood that really emphsises
        this. I grew up in Cyprus, a country that is hot and dry, perfect for
        reptiles. On one particlarly hot summer's day, my younger brother and I
        were playing outside. We always kept cats and as you may or may not
        know, cats, especially Cypriot ones, are really good at catching snakes.
        Well, on this day, one of our cats, Tommy, decided to catch a snake and
        bring it into our yard. Alive. I saw the snake and I was ecstatic. I ran
        to my mum to tell her and she responded in a way that was shocking to
        me. She reacted in pure fear. She closed us inside the house and ran to
        call the neighbour. I didn't know why but I didnt stay ignorant for long
        when I saw the neighbour run over with a shovel. I screamed and cried
        but it did nothing. The snake was now dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mum said I didn't speak to her for days after the incident and I kept
        repeating how much I hated her.
      </p>
      <p>
        She says that its from this point that she knew how attached I was to
        snakes. I started reading about them, learning about them, talking about
        them, and my family started learning more as a result and was exposed to
        the ignorance that surrounds snakes and the unbased fear of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm happy to say that my mum never caused the death of a snake again. In
        fact now she happily cares for one.
      </p>
      <h3>Getting Gambit</h3>
      <p>
        When I became a teenager, I realsied I could keep a snake as a pet. We
        already had many pets by this point, thanks to yours truly, so keeping
        pets was nothing new to my parents
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this is where my mum would draw the line. Absolutely no snakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        As is evidenced by this page, that stance did not last, but it was a
        tough one to break.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dad and I launched a campaign. Every pet shop we went to we looked at
        the snakes. And every time we came back home we spoke about it with my
        mum.
      </p>
      <p>
        This went on for a couple of years until one fateful day when I found
        Gambit. I still remmber when I picked him up from his plastic box in the
        pet shop how cold and small he was (the evils of the improper care often
        taken in the live pet industry that I was too young to understand). We
        rushed home, I begged my mum, my dad spoke to her, and by some miracle,
        she said a very reserved "yes".
      </p>
      <p>I picked him up the next day and as they say, the rest is history.</p>

      <p>This is a website dedicated to my milk snake, <em>Gambit</em>.</p>
      <p>
        I created this website as a way to practice my coding skills but also to
        celebrate Gambit's life.
      </p>
      <p>
        He's getting old now and I am more aware every day how lucky I am to
        have him in my life. As I currently live in a different country to him,
        I felt this was a great way to keep a record of him and be reminded of
        him as often as I can be.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will keep this site updated with any news, photos, or interesting
        stories related to Gambit either currently or from the past.
